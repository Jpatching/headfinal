# Leaderboard and Matchmaking Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the leaderboard and matchmaking systems to ensure they work reliably with live results and support concurrent users.

## Leaderboard Improvements

### Enhanced Leaderboard Component
- Added real-time updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Implemented fallback polling for browsers that don't support SSE
- Added manual refresh button for immediate updates
- Added timestamp display to show when data was last updated
- Improved error handling and loading states

### Server-Side Leaderboard Improvements
- Created a dedicated SSE endpoint (`/api/leaderboard/stream`) for real-time updates
- Optimized the main leaderboard API to support different leaderboard types (wins/winnings)
- Added proper caching headers and dynamic route handling
- Implemented concurrency-safe data access in the leaderboard service

### Redis Optimizations for Leaderboard
- Used Redis sorted sets for efficient leaderboard ranking
- Implemented atomic operations to prevent race conditions
- Added error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Matchmaking Improvements

### Enhanced Matchmaking Service
- Implemented Redis transactions for atomic operations to prevent race conditions
- Added proper locking mechanisms using Redis WATCH command
- Improved error handling and logging
- Created a system to handle expired match requests

### New Matchmaking API Features
- Added support for multiple actions (create, find, cancel, check)
- Implemented Server-Sent Events for real-time match status updates
- Added proper error handling and validation

### Client-Side Matchmaking Utilities
- Created a comprehensive client library for matchmaking operations
- Implemented SSE-based real-time updates with polling fallback
- Added timeout handling and automatic request cancellation
- Provided clear status reporting and error handling

### Scheduled Cleanup
- Added a script to clean up expired match requests
- Ensured reliable garbage collection of abandoned requests

## Deployment and Testing

### How to Test the Leaderboard
1. Open the leaderboard page in multiple browser windows
2. Make game bets and complete matches in one window
3. Observe the leaderboard updating in real-time in other windows
4. Test the manual refresh button if updates aren't automatic

### How to Test Matchmaking with Multiple Users
1. Open the app in two different browsers or private windows
2. Log in with two different accounts
3. Create match requests with the same bet amount
4. Verify both users get matched together
5. Test edge cases like cancellations and timeouts

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Redis memory usage and implement cleanup of old data
2. Add more detailed analytics and monitoring
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Consider sharding for horizontal scaling when user volume increases
5. Add more comprehensive error reporting and alerting
