# Matchmaking and Betting System Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the "place bet and find opponent" functionality in the application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Function Signature Mismatch**:
   - The `createMatchRequest` function in `matchmaking-service.ts` expected a full `MatchRequest` object
   - However, it was being called from `play/page.tsx` with just `(walletPublicKey, betAmount)`
   - Fixed by adding a wrapper function with the correct signature

2. **Redis ZADD Format Issues**:
   - Ensured all Redis ZADD commands use the correct format: `{ score: value, member: key }`
   - This is critical for Upstash Redis compatibility

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Standardized error handling across all matchmaking functions
   - Added proper error objects with descriptive messages

4. **Function Return Types**:
   - Updated all functions to return standardized response objects: `{ success, error }` or `{ matchRequest, error }`, etc.
   - Ensures consistent API across all components

## Main Components Updated

1. **lib/matchmaking-service.ts**:
   - Added compatible function signatures for `createMatchRequest` and `findMatch`
   - Updated `cancelMatchRequest` to match function signature used by the UI

2. **app/api/matchmaking/route.ts**:
   - Updated handler functions to work with the new standardized return types
   - Fixed error handling

3. **app/play/page.tsx**:
   - No changes needed here, as we adapted the backend functions to match the existing UI calls

## How to Deploy

1. Push these changes to the main branch
2. Deploy using the `deploy.ps1` script

## Testing

To test the betting functionality:

1. Connect your wallet on the homepage
2. Click "Play & Bet" 
3. Select a bet amount (e.g., 0.01 SOL)
4. Click "Find Opponent"
5. Wait for the match to be found

If another developer needs to test with you:
1. Both use the same bet amount
2. One person starts searching first
3. The second person should search within 30 seconds

## Redis Verification

You can verify Redis is properly connected and functioning by running:
```
node scripts/verify-redis.js
```
