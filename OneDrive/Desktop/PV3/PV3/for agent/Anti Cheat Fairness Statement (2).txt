ðŸŽ® Anti-Cheat & Game Fairness Statement â€“ PV3
Gaming

Last Updated: [Insert Date]
PV3 Gaming is a skill-based, decentralized gaming platform committed to fairness, transparency, and
zero tolerance for cheating or manipulation. This document outlines the safeguards and values
underpinning the integrity of all 1v1 games hosted on PV3.

1.

Game Validation Architecture
â€¢ All games must support server-side validation via WebSocket or backend logic.
â€¢ No client-only games allowed â€” results must be signed and verified.
â€¢ Every match is recorded via:
â€¢ Match ID (timestamped)
â€¢ Player A and Player B public keys
â€¢ Game outcome, round events, and final score

2.

Exploit Prevention
â€¢ Games must not include hidden RNG or frame-biased physics
â€¢ Any known exploits must be disclosed immediately by developers
â€¢ Backend systems run continuous monitoring for:
â€¢ Suspicious win rates
â€¢ Repeated matchmaking patterns
â€¢ Desync between client/server results

3. ðŸ“¦ SDK Requirements for Developers
â€¢ PV3 provides a standard SDK to ensure:
â€¢ Secure session initiation
â€¢ Server-authoritative winner reporting
â€¢ Encrypted or signed match logs (if possible)
â€¢ Game submissions undergo internal audit before going live

Dispute System

If a player disputes a match result: 1. PV3 admin can review match logs or gameplay replay 2. A human
override may refund or declare a new winner in rare edge cases 3. Abusers of the dispute process may
be suspended

5.

Anti-Bot Measures
â€¢ No automation tools, macros, or bots are permitted
â€¢ Players caught with irregular inputs or time precision will be flagged
â€¢ For Unity/React games, input randomization filters may be added

6. âš™ Game Audit Timeline
â€¢ Every whitelisted game is reviewed before deployment
â€¢ Periodic audit checks may be triggered if:
â€¢ A game rapidly increases in popularity
â€¢ Win/loss patterns show imbalance

7.

Player Reports & Feedback
â€¢ Players may report unfair gameplay or suspected cheating
â€¢ Reports will be logged and reviewed within 24â€“72 hours
â€¢ Repeated offenders will be warned, banned, or blacklisted

8.

Admin Failsafe Mechanism

To maintain trust and protect funds: - A 2-of-3 admin multisig can trigger emergency actions: - Unlock
abandoned vaults (e.g. after 48h idle) - Pause platform during active exploit - All actions are logged onchain, limited by smart contract, and fully transparent - Signers: Alex (CEO), Josh (CTO), Neutral DAO/
Legal Signer

9.

Commitment to Fairness
â€¢ PV3 will never host house games or act as a player
â€¢ All matches are PvP-only
â€¢ The platform has no incentive to rig outcomes, as it earns a flat platform fee

Final Notes
This statement may evolve as more games are onboarded and new game types emerge (e.g. FPS, Chess
Blitz, Arcade). PV3 is committed to maintaining skill-based integrity at all costs.
Let me know if you'd like to publish this as a transparency section on the landing page or within a game
fairness explorer dashboard.
