PV3 Security Architecture FAQ
Last Updated: [Insert Date]
This document explains how PV3 is designed to be fundamentally resistant to hacking, exploits, and
mass-drain scenarios. It serves as a formal overview for security reviews, audit partners, legal counsel,
and investor due diligence.

Are User Funds Safe on PV3?
Yes. PV3 uses a non-custodial hybrid vault model where: - Users deposit into their own Program
Derived Address (PDA) - Vaults are locked to their wallet and isolated from others - No backend or
platform admin can move user funds arbitrarily

What Are PDAs and Why Are They Safe?
PDAs (Program Derived Addresses): - Are deterministic Solana addresses owned by a smart contract, not
a private key - Can only be controlled by the specific program that created them - Cannot be bruteforced or taken over ‚Äî there is no private key to steal
Bottom line: PDAs are the backbone of non-custodial Solana DeFi security.

üîí Can Someone Drain Multiple Vaults?
No. Vaults are single-user scoped. Each PDA: - Belongs to one wallet only - Can‚Äôt be accessed by another
user or hacker - Doesn‚Äôt expose its keys (because none exist)
Even if a frontend or backend is compromised, vault funds are still safe.

üïπ What About Game Result Exploits?
Match payouts only occur when: - A signed result is submitted by the Verifier Service - This service runs
on a backend controlled by the PV3 team - Each match result is hashed, signed, and validated before
payout
‚ö† Clients cannot spoof wins. All games must go through verification.

üõ† What If a Vault Becomes Inactive?
Failsafe protections include: - A 2-of-3 multisig can act if a vault is idle for 48+ hours - Only limited
actions (withdrawals to rightful owners, stuck match resolution) are possible - All actions are logged onchain and auditable

üîç What Is the Risk of a Smart Contract Bug?
‚Ä¢ All contracts will undergo independent third-party audit (e.g., OtterSec, Zellic, Sec3)
‚Ä¢ Fuzzing, simulation, and bug bounty will follow audit
‚Ä¢ The code is modular and simple ‚Äî no complex reentrancy or flash-loan risk

Can Platform Admins Steal Funds?
No. - The platform never holds your funds - Admins cannot drain vaults or execute payouts - Multisig
actions are heavily restricted and visible to all users

What If a Match Is Interrupted?
‚Ä¢ Matches have a timeout feature to auto-refund
‚Ä¢ Partial or fake matches do not result in any payout
‚Ä¢ Edge cases are handled securely with clear on-chain logic

Why PV3 Is Safer Than Custodial Platforms
‚Ä¢ No pooled hot wallet risk
‚Ä¢ No backend-controlled fund storage
‚Ä¢ Everything is transparent, permissioned, and auditable
