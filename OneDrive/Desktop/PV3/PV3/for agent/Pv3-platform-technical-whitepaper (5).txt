ðŸŽ® PV3 - Full Technical & Operational Whitepaper
Platform Overview
PV3 is a non-custodial, Solana-based 1v1 skill gaming platform. All matches are powered by smart
contracts and verified outcomes. Players wager SOL, compete, and the winner takes the pot minus a
6.5% platform fee.
Built for: - Competitive PvP gameplay - Verifiable on-chain outcomes - Fair rewards and community trust

Core Platform Logic
Match Lifecycle (WebSocket Flow + Solana)
1. Player A initiates match â†’ deposit SOL â†’ createMatch() on Solana
2. Player B joins â†’ match escrow initialized (PDA per match)
3. Match begins via WebSocket â†’ both clients sync
4. Game finishes â†’ Verifier microservice signs result payload
5. Signature submitted to Solana â†’ submitResult() â†’ winner paid
6. Timeout condition â†’ contract checks expiry and refunds

â›“ Escrow Design (Per-Match Isolation)
â€¢ Every match uses a PDA vault
â€¢ Ensures no global funds are at risk
â€¢ Immutable match data structure: creator, joiner, wager, expiry, gameId

Verifier Service
â€¢ Off-chain signer that issues a valid ed25519 signature on the winner's outcome
â€¢ Matches are invalid unless signature is confirmed on-chain
â€¢ Centralized for now, but logs every match hash for auditability

Game Modularity + SDK
Internal Games
â€¢ Built in React + WebSocket + HTML5 DOM rendering
â€¢ Each game implements a deterministic loop and movement log
â€¢ Signature generated off client-side game data + server-side validation

External Games (Whitelist Future)
â€¢ Developers submit via dev/ SDK tools:

1

â€¢ game_metadata.json
â€¢ Game logic + client files
â€¢ Result verifier code
â€¢ Each submission is reviewed internally
â€¢ Approved games are added to on-chain registry
Game Metadata Example:

{
"id": "chess_blitz",
"min_bet": 0.01,
"max_bet": 1.0,
"verifier": "verifier_chess_blitz",
"version": "1.0.0"
}

Rewards & Referrals
Fee Split
â€¢ 6.5% platform fee
â€¢ 5.5% to platform treasury
â€¢ 1% to referral/reward pool

Referral System
â€¢ Track referrals by unique code per wallet
â€¢ Backend distributes share of 1% fee to referring users
â€¢ Claims handled via frontend claim portal

ðŸª™ Tokenomics (Future Phase)
â€¢ $PV3 Token: 1,000,000,000 total supply (locked at launch)
â€¢ Future utility: boost rewards, DAO voting, sponsor tournaments
â€¢ Treasury wallet receives partial allocations once token launched
DAO Integration: - Post-token launch â†’ snapshot-style governance - Community votes on game
additions, fee changes, partnerships

Game Fairness & Anti-Cheat
Match Trust Model
â€¢ All matches are player-vs-player only (no bots)
â€¢ Each player client logs:
â€¢ Position frames (x, y)

2

â€¢ Match timer checkpoints
â€¢ Final action state

Verification System
â€¢ Game logic is deterministic â†’ same input = same result
â€¢ Verifier service signs result hash â†’ verified on-chain
â€¢ No payout occurs unless signed match result is posted

Anti-Cheat Policies
â€¢ Timeout system refunds disconnected or inactive matches
â€¢ Admin tools allow blacklisting abusive wallets
â€¢ Optional game replay logs for internal analysis

ðŸ›  Admin Tools
â€¢ Admin panel:
â€¢ Force payout, refund, or nullify
â€¢ Match history + real-time view
â€¢ Ban wallet, freeze game
â€¢ All admin actions logged with timestamp + signer key

ðŸ“ˆ Analytics Dashboard (MVP Phase)
Tracks: - Total volume - Number of matches per day - Number of active players - Wager sizes by tier Referral rewards distributed

Versioning & Deployment
â€¢ Contracts: versioned via tags (v1.0, v1.1â€¦)
â€¢ Backend: tag by deployment ( /api/v1 , /api/v2 )
â€¢ Frontend: /v1 , /v2 URLs supported
â€¢ All releases are documented in /docs/CHANGELOG.md

Legal Structure
â€¢ Registered in British Virgin Islands (BVI)
â€¢ Operates under skill-based platform jurisdiction
â€¢ Geo-restricted from UK
â€¢ Smart contract handles funds â€“ platform never takes custody

Platform is bootstrapped â€” founders incur no third-party development costs.

ðŸ“ˆ Pump.fun Benchmark Comparison
Pump.fun Growth Overview:
â€¢ Reached over 100,000 DAU in under 6 months
â€¢ Estimated platform fees exceed $1.5M/month in peak months
â€¢ Heavy usage from degen/retail due to simplicity, virality, and low fees

If PV3 Mirrors Pump.fun Trajectory:
Assumptions: - PV3 reaches 50,000â€“100,000 DAU over 6â€“12 months - Average game stake remains $14
(â‰ˆ 0.082 SOL) - Similar viral growth pattern from competitive, fun, real-money gameplay
