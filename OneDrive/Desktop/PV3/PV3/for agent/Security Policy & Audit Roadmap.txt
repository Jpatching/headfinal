Security Policy & Audit Roadmap â€“ PV3 Gaming
Last Updated: [Insert Date]
PV3 Gaming is committed to a secure, transparent, and user-first environment. This document outlines
the platformâ€™s approach to security, including audits, failsafe mechanisms, and ongoing protections
against exploits.

1. ðŸ›¡ Core Security Principles
â€¢ Non-custodial by design: User funds stored in PDAs controlled by smart contracts, not the
platform
â€¢ Game integrity: All games are validated server-side and reviewed before launch
â€¢ Transparency-first: Key actions, payouts, and overrides are logged on-chain

2. Hybrid Vault Architecture
â€¢ Each user deposits SOL into a session PDA
â€¢ PDA is used to fund wagers across multiple matches in a session
â€¢ Users withdraw unused balance at any time
â€¢ Minimizes wallet interruptions and improves UX

3. Admin Failsafe Multisig (Hybrid Custody Safety Net)
To prevent loss of user funds due to inactivity, exploits, or unhandled edge cases:
â€¢ A 2-of-3 multisig has limited emergency powers
â€¢ Composed of:
â€¢ Alex (CEO)
â€¢ Josh (CTO)
â€¢ Legal/DAO Community Signer

Powers of the Failsafe:
Logged OnChain?

Action

Conditions

Unlock stuck vault (e.g. 48h+ idle)

Must be verified inactive and
unclaimed

Yes

Pause game matchmaker

Only during confirmed exploit

Yes

1

Action

Conditions

Recover misrouted or invalid
deposits

Verified via support log

Logged OnChain?
Yes

All such actions are limited by the smart contract logic and only usable in specific verified conditions.
Users will always be able to verify any failsafe action retroactively.

4. Smart Contract Audit Plan
â€¢ All on-chain programs (match escrow, vault manager, signer logic) will be audited pre-launch
â€¢ Audit provider options: OtterSec, Sec3, Zellic, Halborn
â€¢ Minimum 1 full formal audit before mainnet
â€¢ Re-audit after major feature releases (e.g. token rewards layer)

5. Continuous Monitoring
â€¢ Match integrity logs saved to off-chain DB (via verifier/)
â€¢ Automated risk triggers:
â€¢ Abnormally high win rates
â€¢ Match result signature mismatches
â€¢ Rapid replay detection (bot behavior)

6. Bug Bounty Program
â€¢ Open to public and whitehat researchers
â€¢ Hosted on Immunefi or private bounty board
â€¢ Rewards range from $500â€“$10,000+ depending on severity

7. ðŸ”’ Backend/Infra Security
â€¢ Backend services use OAuth + rate limiting
â€¢ Player data stored in encrypted Postgres DB
â€¢ Games sandboxed in iframes to avoid DOM injection
â€¢ Future: encrypted match state logs

Summary
PV3 prioritizes smart contract-level safety, hybrid non-custodial access, and complete transparency. The
admin multisig ensures user funds are recoverable only when justified and auditable â€” no silent rugpulls or opaque operations.
