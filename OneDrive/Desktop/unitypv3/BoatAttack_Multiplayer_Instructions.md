# BoatAttack Multiplayer Setup Guide

## Quick Start (After Unity Opens Successfully)

1. **Open Unity** and wait for all packages to finish importing
2. **Open the Main Menu scene**: `Assets/scenes/main_menu/main_menu.unity`
3. **Add the QuickMultiplayerStart script** to any GameObject in the scene

## Testing Multiplayer

### Method 1: Quick Test Script
1. In the scene, create an empty GameObject
2. Add the `QuickMultiplayerStart` component to it
3. Set `autoStartMultiplayer = true` in the inspector

### Method 2: Keyboard Controls (In Play Mode)
- Press **F1** to start multiplayer connection
- Press **F2** to start the race (master client only)

### Method 3: Multiple Instances
1. Build the project (File > Build Settings > Build)
2. Run the built executable
3. Also press Play in Unity Editor
4. Both instances will connect to the same room and race together

## Important Notes

## Troubleshooting
